After reading “Everybody lies: how Google search reveals our darkest secrets,” by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, I unfortunately found myself unsurprised by the notion of humanity being darker than it seems, but quite surprised by the idea that data can be used to better understand the human psyche. I, just like many others, tend to dislike surveys– especially when there is no reward. The lack of incentive, along with the lack of connection with the survey reviewer, makes me care less about the truth of my answer, and, in order to get something out of it, I tend to respond with answers of who I wish to be, or what I wish I did. This renders an ultimate flaw in the majority of surveys– people always want to be better versions of themselves. We are social creatures, and we always want ourselves to look appealing, even if we’re anonymous to a distant survey reviewer. This is why I agree with Seth Stephens-Davidowitz that Google and other similar data can give us information far greater than surveys can. I believe the illusion of anonymity when searching the internet allows people to drop their “social mask.” This can be a good thing, like Stephens-Davidowitz said, “there can be comfort in knowing you are not alone in your insecurities and embarrassing behaviour.” Seeking information without judgement is very important, however, this is about as far as the benefits go before the our darkness begins to unfold. One issue, however, that I did find with Stephens-Davidowitz’s point was when he spoke of our darker side, “Many people are, for good reason, inclined to keep their prejudices to themselves. I suppose you could call it progress that many people today feel they will be judged if they admit they judge other people based on their ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion. But many Americans still do.” Now, the point where I differ from Stephens-Davidowitz is that I see a big difference between admitting prejudices to a person, and to a computer. I would not hesitate to call the this progress, for we have changed the social norm (which is a pretty big step). As I’m writing this I’m finding myself unsure of my own argument. The true question here boils down to this one, and since I am having great difficulty answering it, I will stop arguing useless points and leave you with it instead:


Do we judge humanity by what we deem acceptable or how we truly think???
