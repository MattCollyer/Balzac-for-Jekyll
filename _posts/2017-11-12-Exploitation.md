I believe in order to live in this world, one must always expect exploitation. I think exploitation is innate, and no matter the system that governs us, we will always have to be on guard for it. A major problem lies within the differences between the connotation and denotation of exploitation. I see exploitation as it is denoted, where it can be mere trickery and benefit, whereas others believe it occurs with a true power imbalance where the victims are trapped. I have come to see exploitation as a byproduct of interaction, and thusly am not opposed to it. However, I am very opposed to the cruel connoted definition which capitalism definitely facilitates. I think that clickbait or any automated reward system, while annoying, is harmless exploitation. So do I think that the current issue James Bridle writes about in his article “Something is wrong on the internet” is okay? 

Hell no. 

There is no harmless exploitation when it comes to children. We are (although I totally am NOT) adults. We understand what it is like to live in this world, we know we can be exploited and taken advantage of. We’ve learned this. So if we fall into a pit of exploitation (mere trickery) to some degree it is our fault. We know these pitfalls exist and should be on guard. 
Children have not learned this, children have no guard to this. And they cannot learn from this- the exploitation is so camouflaged they will not even know that they’ve been exploited. 
Children are easily fooled, which makes their exploitation more rewarding, and thus as much more inhumane. My stance on this is rigid.

Maybe my opinion on clickbait for adults will change with the advancement of these digital systems, but for now I’ll hold myself accountable if I fall for harmless types of exploitation.
