The Computer of the 21st Century, by Mark Weiser, touches on some very interesting points considering the date of its publication. While some were more accurate than others, one thing is true, that technology has embedded itself so deep into our daily lives that it is often rendered invisible. Though the tech is a bit different than he imagined, the effect is ultimately the same: it’s extremely difficult, even in rural Vermont, to escape computers. One interesting difference is that he spoke of devices knowing your whereabouts as a good thing. This is because the so called ‘tabs’ in his vision of the future would not upload the information and without your knowledge sell it to third parties, giving them a rough profile of you to better target you with advertisements. I guess capitalism made a mess of this too :(

I also found it very interesting how his vision of the future had tabs everywhere, even in a manual. This would be very wasteful. Technology is constantly improving, it's already becoming the largest type of waste. If his world were to be true, I believe it would be even more of an issue.
