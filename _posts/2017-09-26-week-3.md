Philosophy of Data
Week 3

Since reading the article ‘Right to Be Forgotten’ Online Could Spread, by Farhad Manjoo, I  have become more concerned about the future of governments, and how they interact. All I can say is that I hope no major conflicts arise due to this. 

I found this quote to be quite important: 
“You guys are now in charge of editing what’s out there in the world,” he said, describing the court’s guidance to Google. “In the past that’s not a responsibility we felt we had.
This is all I could think about while reading the article. We’re giving Google ultimate authority. How long until Google has more power than a country? 

My wacky code:

```
import csv
import random
term_list = []
with open ('queries_2017.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:
	reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter = '\t')
	for row in reader:
		term_list.append(', '.join(row))

purpose=["because ","since ", "due to the fact that "]
subjectverbs=["I like ", "I hate ", "I love ", "You are ", "I see"]
prepositions=["in the ", "on the ", "at the ", "into ","near the ", "with ", "by the "]

adjectives=["ugly ", "beautiful ", "stupid ", "poisonous ", "vile ", "disgusting ", "pointless ", "loveable ", "evil", "wonderful"]
i=0
while i<3:
	print(random.choice(subjectverbs))
	print(random.choice(term_list))
	print(random.choice(prepositions))
	print(random.choice(term_list))
	print(random.choice(purpose))
	print(random.choice(term_list))
	print("is "+random.choice(adjectives))
	if i<2:
		print("and")
	i+=1
